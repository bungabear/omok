Gomuku is a game in which players alternate turns placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. The winner is the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Features to be added

1) 3x3 rule
2) Time limits
3) Undo turns

 
1) 3x3 rule
The rule of three and three bans a move that simultaneously forms two open rows of three stones (rows not blocked by an opponent's stone at either end).
Since there was a method which guarantees the player who starts first(black) to win, 3x3 was banned as a rule.

(As shown above, if the black puts the stone in the marked place, no matter if  which way the white side blocks, the black side wins.)



2) Time-limit rule

There should be a finite amount of time spent on each turn.
For each turn, there is n second time limit, and if a player does not abide this rule the player gets disqualified, and the opponent automatically wins.



3) Undo turns

It would be inconvenient to start over again because of a single miss click.
Undoing a turn makes the stone put on the field during the previous turn disappear.
